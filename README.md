# X-O Game
## Description

This project demonstrates how to build a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java, incorporating object-oriented programming principles to ensure a user-friendly and interactive experience.
By leveraging Java's core concepts, including classes, objects, and inheritance, I carefully created the structure and functionality of the game.
